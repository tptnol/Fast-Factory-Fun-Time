# Fast Factory Fun Time

### An evil factory foreman named Bacob Jirkland is shutting down all your fellow robots. It's up to you to stop him, get to him quickly or else they'll die on you! Run through the factory, dodge the nasty spiders and bots working for him, and get to the flag!
### This is definitely one of the fastest games I've made. Not for the feint of heart.
### Literally the Dark Souls of platformers.

# Controls:

## Keyboard:

### Arrow keys to move
### Space to jump and start
### R to restart
### P to pause 

## Controller:

### Left stick to move
### A to jump
### Start to start and X to restart

# I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING A CONTROLLER FOR THIS

# Goal:

### Touch the flag at the end of all 8 levels. Each level is its own problem (different gravity and terminal velocity); use your problem solving skills to finish it!
### Get as much points as possible! Getting hit by an enemy makes you lose a life and 100 score. Getting a Health Item while you have max health gets you 100 points.
### If you run out of lives, it's over! Restart and try again!
### There's a really short timer to deal with. Go fast or you're dead!

# Scoring:

### If you have max hearts and you get a Health Item, you gain 100 points.
### If you get hit by an enemy, you lose 100 points.
### Points don't really matter in the grand scheme of things. It won't matter if you can't pass the level.
